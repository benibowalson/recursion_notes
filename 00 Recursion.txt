RECURSION

1. What is least amount of work I can do?
2. What would be my job complete signal?

const doRecursion = (someVar) => {
	if(someConditionFulfilledOn(someVar)) return

	return doRecursion(someNextVar)
}

1. Handle base case (work complete)
2. Recurse with the smallest amount of work that can be done
